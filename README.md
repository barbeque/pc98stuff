# pc98stuff

A repository of random PC-98-related source code I've either written or found on the internet or dumped from floppies included in Japanese books.

Note: text files are encoded using Shift-JIS. Please refrain from converting to UTF-8 in pull requests, as it creates issues with PC-98 toolchains and editors. (Don't worry, I'm a huge UTF-8 fan, it's just a practical issue with these old machines!)
